<h1>Uncapped vs. Capped Outcomes</h1>

<p>A young ambitious person who is also academic (likely to be a high school or college student) needs a system that allows students to achieve uncapped outcomes. 
Here's the thought experiment - if a student crushes it (builds projects, internalises mindsets, develops friendships with driven people globally, grows their network, etc...), their best-case scenario is uncapped. 

They could build a billion-dollar company, discover new techniques in liquid biopsy for early cancer detection, join SpaceX's battery team that powers Starlink... 
their ambition is the limit of their potential. 

Now let's think about what the outcome would be if a student crushed school (got the best grades, performed incredibly at their extracurriculars, student council president, etc...), 
their best-case scenario is likely capped to 2 things: (1) they get into a top-tier university and (2) they get a full-ride scholarship. 
Still great outcomes, but they are capped to those outcomes, which are means to an end. 

Given the state of the world, access to technology, and the proliferation of opportunities, young people have the potential to achieve far more than ever before in history. 
They need new systems that don't limit them. 
Systems and frameworks that, if done well, give them uncapped outcomes, 
while complementing to still enabling them to achieve the best-case outcomes of the traditional education system (i.e. students of this new system go to top-tier universities and get full-ride scholarships because of their work during this new system).

Systems like tks.world or Project Dynamo are among the first to allow uncapped outcomes.</p>
