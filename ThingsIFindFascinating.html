<p>Inspired by Patrick Collison's <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/questions">Questions</a>. I will be able to answer why these things are the way they are when I can describe what they mean to me (realising I may never fully comprehend some). If you have any more great examples of things one may find fascinating, feel free to send them to me. I'm j0shroy on X</p>
