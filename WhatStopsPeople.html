<h1>What Stops People</h1>

<h2>(based on my own personal experience and hearing others)</h2>

<p>8th May, 2024 by Josh Roy</p>

<li>Time being spent on obligations that they don’t want to do but have to (common example: school/university). Know your have vs. wants.

<li>Lack of direction

<li>Lack of focus (mistaken with lack of knowledge, when everyone has the ability to learn)
  
<li>Procrastination

<li>Getting distracted (it’s easy these days due to the abundance of technology and any website/app/digital entertainment being only a click away). The antidote I've found to this is always work in an office environment/quiet library for deep work 

<li>Not knowing that you have a 1 in 400 trillion chance of existing in the universe
  
<li>Not being convinced enough (we live in the luckiest age in humanity - capped vs. uncapped outcomes)

<li>Being in the perpetual state of fatigue (due to not generating results - very hard cycle to break)

<li>Overthinking

<li>Laziness

<li>Arrogance (not being open-minded or willing to adapt)

<li>Being in the wrong environment

<li>Bad circle of friends or trying to fit in (related to the above point)

<li>Bad information diet

<li>Not being resourceful

<li>Bad routine

<li>Lacking in sleep, diet and exercise

<li>Education system

<p>If you were serious enough, you would just do it.</p>
