<h1>Don't Get Bogged Down in Excitement</h1>

<h3>A Common Pitfall I've Realised Among Ambitious Individuals?</h3>

<li>4th March, 2024 by Josh Roy</li>

<li>While it's great to be excited about what you'll achieve and the possibilities that await, something I've observed in ambitious, high-achieving communities (like in The Knowledge Society) among a lot of my driven friends and acquaintances (and something I've certainly fallen victim to often), is that the excitement/visualisation of the desired outcome occupies your mind so much that it limits your human potential (i.e. you start to procrastinate, become obsessed and don't take actions that will propel you towards your desired outcome).</li>
<li>One antidote I've found to this is balance: to become obsessed with the process as well as the desired outcome that you seek. Then you take actions and don't get bogged down in excitement.</li>

<li>If anyone else has any other antidotes to this, do share your thoughts and I'll add them to this essay!</li>
